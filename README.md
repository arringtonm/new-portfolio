# Portfolio Project

## About

This project's purpose is to utilize a wide variety of CSS techniques to build a personal portfolio site. Required skills/techniques/technologies include responsive design, flex box, SASS, and transitions and animations.

The instructor will provide feedback on the project as if he were a potential employer.

## Specs

The site is responsive; resizing below 1000px total width should adjust the layout to a more "mobile friendly" orientation. Gallery items and links should demonstrate hover decorations when selected. The welcome paragraph text should slide into the screen from a non viewable area and gently "bounce" into place upon loading of the page.

## Legal etc

The project was created by Michael Arrington in 2017 to satisfy requirements for an Epicodus project and is released with an MIT license.
